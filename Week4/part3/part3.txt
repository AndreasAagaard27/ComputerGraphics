Reflection on Affine Transformations and Viewing Transformations

Part 1:

Transformations Used:
1. Orthographic Projection:
   P = ortho(l, r, b, t, n, f)
   
2. Translation:
   T = translate(tx, ty, tz)

3. Rotation about x-axis:
   Rx = rotateX(angleX)

4. Rotation about y-axis:
   Ry = rotateY(angleY)

Current Transformation Matrix (CTM) for the Cube:
CTM = P * (T * (Rx * Ry))

Where:
- P is the orthographic projection matrix.
- T is the translation matrix.
- Rx and Ry are rotation matrices about the x- and y-axes.

Formula:
CTM = ortho(-1, 2, -1, 2, -2, 2) * (translate(0.5, -0.2, 0) * (rotateX(35.264) * rotateY(45)))


Part 2:

Transformations Used:
1. Perspective Projection:
   P = perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far)

2. Viewing Transformation:
   V = lookAt(eye, at, up)

Current Transformation Matrix (CTM) for Each Cube:
1. For the first viewpoint:
   CTM = P * lookAt([0, 0, 5], [2, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0])

2. For the second viewpoint:
   CTM = P * lookAt([3, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0])

3. For the third viewpoint:
   CTM = P * lookAt([3, 3, 3], [0, 1.1, 0], [0, 1, 0])

Where:
- P is the perspective projection matrix.
- lookAt(eye, at, up) defines the viewing transformation.

Formula:
CTM = perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far) * lookAt(eye, at, up)

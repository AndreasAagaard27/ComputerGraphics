a) What is the difference between Phong shading and Phong lighting (the Phong reflection model)?
Phong Lighting: The model used to compute light interaction (ambient, diffuse, specular).
Phong Shading: The technique where lighting is computed per pixel using interpolated normals.

b) What is the difference between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading?
Flat Shading: Lighting is calculated per triangle. Pro: Fast. Con: Faceted look.
Gouraud Shading: Lighting is calculated per vertex, interpolated across pixels. Pro: Faster than Phong, smooth. Con: Misses highlights.
Phong Shading: Lighting is calculated per pixel. Pro: Accurate highlights. Con: More expensive.
Best for highlights: Phong shading, because it calculates lighting per pixel.

c) What is the difference between a directional light and a point light?
Directional Light: Light rays are parallel and come from a single direction.
Point Light: Light radiates from a specific position in all directions.

d) Does the eye position influence the shading of an object in any way?
Yes, it affects the specular reflection, impacting how highlights are viewed.

e) What is the effect of setting the specular term to (0, 0, 0)?
It removes specular highlights, making the surface appear matte.

f) What is the effect of increasing the shininess exponent (ùõº)?
It makes the specular highlight smaller and sharper, giving a polished look.

g) In what coordinate space did you compute the lighting?
Camera (view) space.
